Restorative yoga is a quiet, meditative practice that brings your body and mind back into balance. We use props such as bolsters and blocks (or comfy cushions and pillows) to enable us to hold a pose for several minutes at a time. During this stillness you concentrate on your breathing, bringing about a state of deep calm to both your body and mind. With every exhalation, feel yourself relaxing completely.

#### Let the props support you

Restorative yoga and the use of props allows the body to unwind stress and tension. Staying still in the poses helps you feel where you might be holding tension in the body, which may help you address certain areas of your life to relieve it. 

Props allow you to put the focus on your breath and the meditative aspect of the practice rather than the physical aspect of the pose.

Whether you use a block or a book, bolster or pillows, having that support really helps you relax into the pose. You don’t need any fancy equipment, a couple of bed pillows or cushions off the sofa will work just fine. Throw in a blanket and an eye pillow if you have one. As you stay still for long periods of time it’s essential to keep warm, so remember to wear layers. I’m one for keeping slipper socks on. 

#### Focus on the breath

I find restorative yoga really quietens my mind. This didn’t happen straight away but over time and practice there’s a sense of peace and being present in the moment. Slipping one restorative class in a week has really helped my more active yoga practice and my mind. Although it might not seem like you’re moving much or getting any exercise, taking the time to be present and relax can have rippling effects across the rest of your life. Taking that little time for you to rest is so important. 

#### Why do we hold the pose for so long

We tend to stay in a pose for 3-5 minutes or even longer. It can take time for our minds and bodies to drop that on the go, busy, multitasking mindset and fall into a state of relaxation. We move into a pose and adjust, get comfy, soften our muscles and bring that focus inwards. We need time to settle into the pose, feel safe and relax. 

During restorative yoga you are creating space for yourself, this can be emotional. It can give you the opportunity to let go or work through emotions that you’ve been holding on to. I like to have a journal beside me so if anything comes up at the end I can let that flow out onto paper. Restorative yoga can be a really powerful practice.
